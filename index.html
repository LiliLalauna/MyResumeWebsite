        <h2> Let me introduce myself through some facts!</h2>
        <img class="roundpic" src="resources/myphoto.jpg" >
        <p>Graduated both high school and university with extravagant big
grades. Then, I helped other students with learning materials on
social sciences while collaborating with Better Students (2015-2016). </p>
<p> Have been a Research Assistant at the National University of Political
Studies and Public Administration (2016-2017), where I developed my
research skills, team player attitude and ability to organize work and
events.</p>
<p>Worked as a Tour Guide inside the building of the Palace of the
Parliament (2015-2016) where I highly enhanced my communication
skills in English, the ability to interact with very different people and
my distributive attention.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to live and study for short periods of time in
Serbia, Albania, Greece and Russia and I succeeded to improve this
way my communication skills, to gain more flexibility and to cherish
multicultural environments. And last but not least to have more
funny stories to share.</p>
<p>Started to work in QA due to my passion for video games. Then I
realized that the very process of ensuring quality was a game I could
hardly get bored of. After 1 month of experience only I got remarked
for giving the best feedback on our AUT, after 3 months I was
already the top bugger on my project. After 1 year of experience I
wrote my first automated test. </p>
<p>In my free time I am working on a Serbian – Romanian Dictionary
application using ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework (with a
database first approach), a SQL Server database and Bootstrap for
styling.</p>
<p>After many failed attempts, I learned how to ride a bike at 28 years
old and proved myself it is never too late to fulfill your dreams.</p>
